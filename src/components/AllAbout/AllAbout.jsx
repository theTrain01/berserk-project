                    Berserk-Seynan-manga Kantaro Miura, telling us the story of fate, friendship, love, combat partnership, fidelity and the desire to achieve his dreams. And there are elves, spirits of nature, bisenenes and cute clay golems.
                    Ah, yes, still ultranasilia, the dark centuries, religious obscurantism, grotesque creatures and vile nobles and politicians. How could you forget about it ...
                    In the center of the narrative are best friends (first) and sworn enemies (later) Gats and Griffith, the first slightly larger, the second slightly less time.
                    The action of the “berserker” takes place in fantasy-setting, and specifically in its part, which is the cultural template of Europe during the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance (plus the conditionally-Drevtsky magic island of Skellig and the rowing under the medieval Indo-Iranians, the Kushan kingdom). The army of mercenaries roam everywhere, geopolitics resembles such the time of Italian wars, a centenary war and wars with the Ottoman Empire (in the role of which Kushan acts).
                    In general, the author loved the European Middle Ages (especially later), and understood it. This is evidenced by the graphics, inspired by the engravings of Dürer, and the design of demons and evil spirits, as if who who had come down from the paintings of Bosch and Bruegel. Yes, and Gats's receivers, from time, when he still wielded more adequate sizes with a sword, and albrecht Dürer were completely discharged from Das Fechtbuch.
                    The plot is also very remarkable. For example, an eclipse leaves no less vivid feelings than a well -known event from one popular dark fantasy cycle. The characters are gradually growing (in both senses), the world surrounding their world also undergoes changes, sometimes very large -scale.
                    Manga was launched by Miura back in 1989 and was released all these thirty-two years until the death of its author in 2021. For the perfectionism of Miura, new chapters went rarely, once every few weeks or even months, therefore, compared to other long-playing Franchises like Naruto and One Piece, there are not many of them - only 380 chapters, united in 40 finished and one unfinished volume. Fans, however, did not express much discontent - such terms allowed the author to carry out significant work and bring each chapter almost to an ideal state.
                    After the death of the author, to continue the manga was entrusted to the best friend of Miura - Mangaka Koji Mori. According to Koji, Miura thoroughly told him the plot of Berserk up to the end and he is going to follow all his ideas, without adding anything from himself. The studio Gaga, founded by Miuura, where people who participated in the creation of a berserker for many years work, will still be engaged in illustrations. New chapters began to be produced on June 24, 2022.
                    In Russia, Manga began to release Eksmo Publishing House in 2010 and completed at seventh volume in 2012. In 2020 began
